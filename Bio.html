<p>
I grew up in Kentucky in a small town just outside Cincinnati, Ohio. I went to Notre Dame Academy high school
where I was active in sports, particularly cross country running, track, and soccer. I took fine art class my 
junior and senior year, not knowing how much I would grow to love it and ultimately choose it as a career. I graduated in 1986.
</p>

<p>
I then went to The Academy of Communicative Art, a two year commercial art college in Cincinnati, Ohio, now known as &quot;The Art Institute of Cincinnati&quot;.
 I received my Associate degree in Commercial Art and Design in 1988.
After graduation, I worked mostly in printing companies learning the industry the &quot;old school&quot; way. Back then, we didn't have computers doing the art work.
 Everything was done by hand and we used dark rooms, light tables, rubylith, huge stat cameras, and good old fashioned stripping. 
But I felt the need to continue my education, as this was the time that Apple computers began to come into the industry. So I attended several colleges and universities over the
years, taking individual courses in graphic design software and technical writing, which has helped my career tremendously.
</p>

<p>
In 1994, I decided to pack up my bags and move to sunny Florida! I landed in St. Petersburg 
and have loved it ever since. I continued working mostly in printing companies in the pre-press departments, learning how to hack through
file formats and now doing trapping, step and repeating digitally in order to get files "print ready". 

<div><b>Over the years, I've worked with the following types of printing:</b>

<ul>
<li>Flexo printing, which is used to print labels and packaging </li>
<li>Silkscreen printing, which is used for signs and T-shirts</li>
<li>Offset printing, which is used for brochures, letterheads, business cards, etc.</li>
<li>Web printing, which is used for printing magazines and catalogs, etc.</li>
<li>Digital printing, full color or black & white copiers, which is used for anything from flyers to posters, etc.</li>
<li>Wide Format printing, another form of digital printing, is used for banners, signs, vehicle wraps, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
I am now attending St. Petersburg College pursuing a Web Designer Certificate. I realize that the graphic design field is changing, and the demand is to learn web design.
I also plan to learn motion graphics and video editing to round off my expertise. After gaining years of experience on the job, I hope to one day own my own business and work
out of my tropical island home while overlooking the caribbean sea...just like every other dreamer!</p>
